Hello!

I'm using prophet to predict future sales.

In input data, the sales volume treated with squared root is used as 'y' value.
And â€‹cap and floor are 100 and 0. 
Additionally, price information is added with`add_regressor`

But some of products, its results is very strange. 
Like below graph, the value is increasing abnormally in the prediction section.

Input Data
